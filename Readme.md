# Command Line Based IT Issue Log Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Command Line Based IT Issue Log Management System** is a Java-based backend application that allows users to log and view IT-related issues using a command-line interface.  
The system uses a **MySQL database** to store issue details and follows a **layered architecture** to ensure clean separation of concerns.

This project is designed to demonstrate core backend concepts such as database connectivity, CRUD operations, and structured project design.

## 🗄️ Database Details

### Database Name
it_issue_db


### Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE issues (
    issue_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    issue_description VARCHAR(200),
    status VARCHAR(20)
);
⚙️ Features
Log IT issues with employee details

View all logged IT issues

Command-line based interaction

Uses MySQL for persistent storage

Clean separation using DAO, DTO, and Service layers

▶️ How to Compile and Run
Step 1: Compile (from src folder)
javac -d ..\bin db\DBConnection.java dto\Issue.java dao\IssueDAO.java daoimpl\IssueDAOImpl.java service\IssueService.java main\MainApp.java
Step 2: Run (from bin folder)
java -cp ".;..\lib\mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar" main.MainApp
🧪 Sample Output
1. Log IT Issue
2. View Issues
3. Exit
Enter choice:
🧠 Architecture Explanation
DTO (Data Transfer Object): Represents issue data

DAO (Data Access Object): Defines database operations

DAO Implementation: Implements SQL logic

Service Layer: Handles business logic

Main Class: Provides CLI interface to users

DBConnection: Manages database connectivity

✅ Advantages
Simple and easy to understand

Real-world IT support use case

Follows standard backend architecture

Suitable for academic and lab submission

🔮 Future Enhancements
Update and close issues

Add priority levels

User authentication

Web or GUI interface

📝 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a command-line based IT Issue Log Management System using Java and MySQL. It provides hands-on experience with JDBC, layered architecture, and backend development fundamentals.
